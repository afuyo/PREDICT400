.59
Binomial probability with n= 6, k= 3, p= 0.59 is 0.28309852118

Binomial distribution with 6 trials and p= 0.59 follows.

# of successes= 0 probability= 0.0048 
# of successes= 1 probability= 0.0410 
# of successes= 2 probability= 0.1475 
# of successes= 3 probability= 0.2831 
# of successes= 4 probability= 0.3055 
# of successes= 5 probability= 0.1759 
# of successes= 6 probability= 0.0422 
Example 2 College Students 0.2831
Example 3 Coin Toss 0.03125
